general notes:
* I used validation functions for each field to have flexibility. For example now the field "has_children" has simple validator () => true. And it may seems like useless but in future there can be some changes. like in some case user must have a children or etc
* I used 
[angular version](https://ng-wizard-form.surge.sh/)

* unfoutinately it was inpossible to use https://github.com/ng-select/ng-select with actual version of angular. But I have used the alternative ui components libary designed specificly for Angular https://material.angular.io. There is the same functionality
* tailwind was used as addition to Materail

[js version](https://js-wizard-form.surge.sh/)

[vue version](https://vue-wizard-form.surge.sh/)
